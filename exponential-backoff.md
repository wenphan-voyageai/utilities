# Exponential Backoff

Exponential backoff is an easy to avoid [rate limit errors](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/rate-limits) or potential limitations with infrastructure capacity or scheduling.

Exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when an error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to implement exponential backoff (with a little bit of jitter) in Python using the [tenacity package](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```
import voyageai

vo = voyageai.Client()

from tenacity import (  
	retry,  
	stop_after_attempt,  
	wait_random_exponential,  
)  # for exponential backoff

@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(multiplier=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))  
def embed_with_backoff(**kwargs):  
    return vo.embed(**kwargs)
